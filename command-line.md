Command-line

The Command-line is like a notepad where you can write simple instructions for the computer, usually on a single line.  Once you have wrttien the instruction and presses 'enter', the computer goes and does what you asked.  The instructions you give here are mainly 'housekeeping' tasks eg. creating a new document, keep all the documents you have written in and organised (moving them around or deleting them), or getting a program running.
